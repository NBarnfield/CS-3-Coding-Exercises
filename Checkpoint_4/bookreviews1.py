"""The program below reads a dataset containing reviews of Donna Tarttâ€™s The Goldfinch in the Amazon book review.
These reviews have been stored in a simple tab separated file, which is nothing more than a plain text file with
columns. The table contains four columns: review score, url, review title and review text.

Your task is to put comments on each line explaining what it does. First few lines are already commented for you.
You can put a copy of the code in your GitHub account with the comments in it. Thanks.  """
